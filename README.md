# Forecasting Data Science Engagement in the Philippines

![Header](header.png)

## Overview

This project highlights the transformative potential of data science in the Philippines, emphasizing its role in reshaping industries and enabling informed decision-making. The objective of the project was to understand the growth opportunities that data science offers within the Philippine context, particularly in terms of engagement across different hierarchical levels within the Filipino community. The analysis focused on posts from relevant Facebook pages using keywords like "data science," "machine learning," and "artificial intelligence" from 2021 to the present. The analysis employed hierarchical forecasting, statistical and machine learning models, and reconciliation strategies to forecast data science engagement levels across distinct hierarchical levels.

The results of the analysis pointed to the AutoARIMA model combined with a Bottom-Up reconciliation strategy as the most promising approach. Notable insights included increased interest and engagement in the Education and Learning cluster, suggesting potential for nurturing data science initiatives in this sector, and an opportunity to promote data science in the Entertainment cluster. The study recommends expanding the scope by incorporating additional social media platforms and exploring diverse hierarchical structures to gain a more comprehensive understanding of community engagement. It also encourages businesses to seize startup opportunities in the education sector and advises data scientists to align their work with community values and interests for optimized engagement.
